![NadiAmsa and Tamil Nadi Palm Leaf](/images/nadivarga.png "Nadi, Varga and Tamil Horoscope Reading")
Nadi Astrology and Tamil Nadi Palm Leaf is a special branch of Vedic Astrology.

Nadi is 150th division of a zodiac house.

Recent research by eminent Astrologers had revealed that the ShodashVarga or 16 divisional charts of a horoscope, matches into the NadiAmsa or D-150.

D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-7, D-9, D-10, D-12, D-16, D-20, D-24, D-27, D-30, D-40, D-45 and D-60 are ShodashVarga divisions.

Using simple divisional math the above divisional numbers gives a set of numbers as below with duplicates removed.

These numbers indicate the unique boundary of one or many divisional charts.

A total of the above such division for any house comes exactly to 150 parts, which is nothing but Nadi and its Amsa.

With this NadiAmsa, one can predict a person's current birth destiny from birth till death.

So be it Tathatsu.
