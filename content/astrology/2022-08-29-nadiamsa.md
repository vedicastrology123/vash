The Jagannatha Hora software gives the Index, Division and Name for each of the Grahas and Lagna of a Lagna chart.

The Lagna in Lagna chart and NadiAmsa lagna placement are the most important for general predictions called as General Chapter reading or "Pothu Kandam" as in Tamil Palm Leaf astrological reading.

The other grahas as per their house lordship and its significance are read from that Graha position and its NadiAmsa position.

For example 10th house is for Career, and if its house lord in Shukra, then its position in Lagna and NadiAmsa chart becomes "Thozhil Kandam" as in Tamil.

In a practical chart, Guru was 9th lord placed was well in 1st house of Mesha, but the Nadi of Guru was in Kataka, which is 8th from 9th. So in the Mahadasa of Guru and Antara of Chandra (placed in 7th Thula), the person lost her father.

So one can read from Tamil Palm leaf, their Life readings, which are costly. Or.

Mathematically calculate as above and get life predictions.
