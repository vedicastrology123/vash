**Astrology Temple secrets**

Refer below youtube for information about the Temple and its carvings which has
Astrological significance.

I am going to analyze the youtube data from vedic astrology point of view.

The temples which has astrological carvings are
* [Pancha Varna Swami temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchavarnaswamy_Temple).
* [Gangai Konda Shozhapuram](https://ariyalur.nic.in/tourist-place/gangaikonda-cholapuram/).
* KazhuKarsula Murthi temple.

All temples are in Tamil Nadu, India.

The carving on the ceiling is in an inverted way. If a ceiling print is taken on a paper, then
the proper sequence will be seen.

Proceeding from the center, you will find the following

* [9 Nava grahas](/articles/nava-grahas/) symbol at the center.
* [12 signs of zodiac](/articles/vedic-astrology-meaning/) around the navagrahas.
* 28 nakshatras squares with Abhijith nakshatra also shown.
* Then it is 20 Vimsamsas.
* 36 Drekanna squares around the vimsamsa square.

### Why Vimsamsa of 20 squares?

 Vimsamsa signifies religious and spiritual development and permanent wisdom.

 Finding Your own [Vimsamsa](https://astrozing.com/vimsamsa-divisional-horoscope-or-varga-birth-chart/) representation in a temple and worshiping that deity as below
