From that position, the ascendant is calculated based on that many hours-minutes, elapsed. Roughly it is 2 hours for each sign.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Another way is - The zodiac degree at which the horizon is at the time of event or birth minus ayanamsa is Ascendant.</p><blockquote><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In Nadi palm leaf readings, the ascendant or lagna degree is called as &#8220;Uyir&#8221; in Tamil, meaning Life breath or Prana.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">&#8220;Mei&#8221; in tamil, meaning Body, is lagna house,</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Uyir-Mei is living body.

Th Solar system moves or drifts as a disk around in the Milky way. This shift is called Ayanamsa or Precession as in Sidereal (Vedic) system.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This Ayanamsa is used to put back the disk to the original position, which gets its &#8220;Start of Aries&#8221; point right.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Why this was done in Vedic is, the basics are in the Karmic theory of Rebirth and Death. So unless the disc or the horoscope is set back to its original zero-ith point, one cannot read the carry-over of Karma from previous births.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">With Start of Aries, calculated and made fixed for a year, the measurement of signs and stars, with constellations (STARs) AND Signs (Rashi), which are more or less stationery, from a geo-centric observations, is INDEPENDENT of seasons on Earth.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">So to summarize geometrically, Vedic Horoscope considers the movement of planets from a Karmic Point called Start of Aries, with constellations and Signs as the background for calculations.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Coming to Analysis, the different theories within Vedic Astrology is vast to predict, the actual karmic effects of a person, from his/her horoscope.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Western Astrology will stay in Earth only, as it depends only on seasons on Earth, so only psychological effects is possible, with it.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Albeit seasons changes on Earth at different places, esp, near South, North and Equator areas. So it cannot be Universal (on Earth). With seasons reference, measuring and something in sky, namely planets, is not scientific.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Vedic is ALWAYS superior than Western.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">BTW, Time delineation using Dasha can be found only in Sidereal Vedic.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">So be it, Tathaastu.</p><blockquote><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Image : Courtesy Google Images</p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape qtext_image zoomable_in_feed" src="/img/qimg-9d560516ab993ae3bc6a17e562082ba4" master_src="/img/qimg-9d560516ab993ae3bc6a17e562082ba4" master_w="259" master_h="194" /></div></div></blockquote></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Nov 02, 2019 11:37 PM PDT</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">Why is the law of karma inexorable?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><blockquote><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Newton's third law is:</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</b></p></blockquote><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=33a8d1&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%2527s_laws_of_motion" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Newton's laws of motion - Wikipedia</a></span></p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This world is forward moving on Time.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Energy and Space are mutable, changeable, but cannot be destroyed or created.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This macro cosmos called Universe is just Energy, Space and Time.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The same Tantra or Formula is for living things also.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The Life-Breath is the main energy sustained by material energy called body.

Ascendant is the sign rising in the eastern direction at the time of casting of chart. The longitudinal position of Ascendant is the mid point of the first house. Mid heaven is the sign directly above the head. It is the midpoint of tenth house. The steps to calculate mid points of other houses are:</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">total difference = Ascendant &#8211; Midheaven</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">difference for one house = total difference divided by three</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">mid point of 11th house = midheaven + difference for one house</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">mid point of 12th house = mid point of 11th house + difference for one house.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Similarly, calculate the mid points of all the other houses to get the bhava chart. The starting point of a bhava is the mean of its and the previous house&#8217;s midpoint. Naturally, the end point of a house is the beginning of the next one.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>How is Rashi Chart different from Chalit Chart?</b></p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>1. Mathematically:</b> Rashi chart assumes that all the houses are equal &#8211; 30 degrees in length. While calculating the positions of ascendant and other planets, we just take the modulo of the degree by 30 and assign the houses. In bhava chart, the mid point of a house, i.e. the bhava madhya, is given a lot of importance. The influence of a house is calculated based on this bhava madhya. e.g. if Ascendant value is 2 degrees, then the influence of the first house extends from approximately 350 degrees to about 17 degrees and not Zero to 30 degrees as would be the case with a rashi chart. The upper and the lower limits of influence of a house are called Bhava Sandhis. Planets are placed in this newly computed Bhava chart &#8211; and we get something called Chalit chart. The rule is simple, if a planet&#8217;s longitude is more than the starting sandhi and less than the end sandhi, it is said to fall in that bhava.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>2. For interpretations:</b> The combinations that are used for interpretations are &#8211; rashi chart along with divisional charts on one hand and bhava charts on other hand. We never mix divisional charts with bhava chart. Planets influence a chart based on the bhava they are situated in. Rule of thumb &#8211; if an interpretation system works only with planets and houses and not signs, you can safely assume that it is working with the chalit chart and not the rashi chart. However, the aspects of planets on other planets are always studied from rashi chart. Similarly exaltation/debilitation of planets is again studied only from the rashi chart. Manglik Dosha is studied partly from bhava chart (e.g. statements like Mars causes dosha if situated in 7th house) and partly from rashi chart. When looking for exceptions (e.g. Mars in Simha, i.e. in the sign of a friend does not cause dosha), we should see the rashi chart. Normally, bhava chart and rashi chart would agree with each other. However, if the Ascendant or planets&#8217; degree is closer to multiple of 30, there may be differences between the charts. It is always interesting to see if a planet has moved from one house to another from rashi chart to chalit chart. This explains a lot of times why a yoga that is so obvious in rashi chart does not fructify in real life.</p><div class="ui_qtext_image_outer"><div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="portrait qtext_image zoomable_in_feed" src="/img/qimg-efa6a2b1995a4dff7c5b5f81098e8c99" master_src="/img/qimg-efa6a2b1995a4dff7c5b5f81098e8c99" master_w="215" master_h="235" /></div></div><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Courtesy : Google Image.</p></blockquote></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Nov 13, 2019 09:43 PM PST</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">How will the Guru Transit (November 2019) into Dhanur affect a Vrischika Rashi person?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The benevolent Guru, will move from Vrischika to Dhanur on Nov 5th 2019, as per panchang.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>Dhanur Rashi</b> House contains the following nakshatra namely</p><ol><li>Moola - 1,2,3,4th pada - Ruled by Ketu</li><li>Purva Shada(Puram) - 1,2,3,4 pada Ruled by Shukra</li><li>Uttara Shada (Uttiradam) - 1 pada Ruled by Surya</li></ol><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">and Guru will transit the above nakshatras.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><b>Vrischika Rashi consists of the following nakshatras namely</b></p><ul><li>Visakha - 4th pada - Ruled by Guru</li><li>Anuradha (Anusham) - 1,2,3,4 pada Ruled by Shani</li><li>Jyeshta (Ketai) - 1,2,3,4 pada Ruled by Budha</li></ul><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Ascertain your Rashi and then your nakshtra and then read your affectations.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Guru transiting the 2nd from Vrischika Rasi is good , overall.

This is an acquired trait by birth.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Moon Sign or Chandra sign is Manas, which operates by acquired data from environment, situations and one&#8217;s own attitude towards oneself and others. This is both acquired by birth and environment.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That is why Vedic Astrology talks about Kaal, Desh and Patra of a horoscope.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">7th house is often a neglected part in this thinking analysis.

Why?. Because Lagna is considered as Trine and as well Quadrant house. So one becomes self-confident of the highest order, which goes by many yogas like Sasa Yoga, Hamsa Yoga and etc.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Example : I have Shani in his own house in Lagna - Makara Lagna Shani, which makes me self-confident in what I think, say and act.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">One has to read for Moon sign and 7th house, and how they are mutually placed from each other.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If a deficiency is found based on these placements, one can avoid those situations, handle it and change the environment or live in a conducive environment to have positive thinking.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Many start straight away with Psychological books to develop positive thinking without knowing what their INERT positiveness and negativeness is. This leads to acquiring too much data but with less implementation details.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">As a famous Philosopher J. KrishnaMurthi had said &#8220;What it is, is more important than What it should be&#8221;.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Unless you do not know &#8220;What you are&#8221;, you cannot become what you want&#8221;.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">So be it, Tathaatsu.</p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Apr 28, 2021 06:50 AM PDT</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">What planetary position shows about the pandemic on the Earth according to the Vedic astrology?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I had written an answer,chck below</p><p class="qtext_para"><span class="qlink_container"><a href="/What-is-the-Vedic-Mundane-Astrological-correlation-for-the-present-Corona-Virus-pandemic-Does-Pluto-Uranus-and-Neptune-which-are-not-Vedic-Grahas-play-a-role/answer/Steve-Hora">Steve Hora's answer to What is the Vedic Mundane Astrological correlation for the present Corona Virus pandemic?

The last column in the below table.<br />So there can only 228 legal letters that can be used for a Name.<br />So there are only 216+12, which can be distributed to each navamsa pada and 12 Rashi's used for names. <br />For example, "Cha" or &#2970; is assigned to Navamsa pada in Vrishabha Rashi. <br />In a sequential way, all the Uyir and Uyir-Mei letters are distributed to All navamsas and Rashis.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Tamil grammar disallows 108 letters as first letter of a word or name.
