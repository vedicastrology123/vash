So it looks like Vimshottari is correct to use, in Kali Yuga.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Ashtottari is based on lunar tithi, which allocates different years to different grahas, excluding Ketu. Including Rahu and excluding Ketu, does not make any logical sense. The reason could be Ketu eclipses Chandra and Ashtottari is based on Chandra&#8217;s tithi.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">But as such the phase or tithi for Chandra or any other graha is there, except for Surya. Because Surya can be only at zero phase from itself. This could be the reason for Surya being given 6 and Chandra given 12+3 = 15 lunar years in Ashtottari.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">To use Ashtottari effectively, this above anomaly has to be corrected, making equal to Vimshottari&#8217;s 120 years, which is naturally correct for Kali Yuga.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This can be corrected as below.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Rahu is allocated 17. Ketu none. Rahu and Ketu as a unit will be allocated 24 as per tithi calculations. So 24 minus 17 is 7.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">So 7 lunar years can be allocated to Ketu.<br />Surya can be 6 lunar years, as Chandra has 15.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The total should come to 120 lunar years, so remaining 5 years can be given to Lagna. Why lagna?. Lagna is a position from Surya in a chart.

The sequence of dasha is different from Vimshotari, which starts from Aridhara nakshatra.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">But applying the same nakshatra-dasha sequence to Tithi Pravesha by PVR Narasimha Rao in <b>Jagannatha Hora </b>software is <b>questionable and WRONG</b>, as this is based on Tithi, and its lords follow a different sequence.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This is a great anomaly.
