### About Author

I am a born astrologer, as per Sri Vaithiswara Agasthiya Koushiha Nadi Grantha in Tamil.
In my palm-leaf reading, one of my profession is mentioned as below

“ஜோதிடமும் கலை சார் அணி பண்டம் ….”

It means Astrology, Graphical Yantras are some of my professions.

I use Vedic (Sidereal) horoscope for Accurate timing and analysis, according to Lahiri Ayanamsa (Chitra paksha), using sidereal solar years of 360, Analysis as per Parasara system and Timing using Vimshottari Dasha system and Samaya Amsa or Kaala or Naadi timing technique.

Astrologically, I love to analyze Vedic (Sidereal) or Western (Tropical) Astrology, comprehend it and solve the unresolved question of human existence, in its various aspects, events, tribulation and the very ending.

(This quality of mine is due to 5th lord Shukra sitting in 4th, and looking at 10th, Ketu is with Shani in Makara lagna. Shukra being my Yogakaraka graha, sitting in Aswini Ketu-nakshatra, in my horoscope).

I challenge the status quo, ad-literam and anecdotal of vedic and western astrology, navigate uncharted waters, to find newer vistas from the astrology lore and find the truth. Be unbiased, even with my own opinion, or by the very information gathered, than to assimilate, digest, critically analyze, synthesize and find the truest path, which had been lost to time.

(This quality of mine is due to Chandra exalted in Vrishabha and Makara Lagna Shani and Ketu sitting in Abhijit nakshatra).

Choose proper time and place and act, even the world, you will win with ease.

#### Astrology - Western and Vedic differences

Vedic and Western astrology have some similarities, including the 12 signs of the zodiac, but Vedic astrology emphasizes the rising sign at the precise moment of birth rather than the 30-day sun sign. Also, the difference between the sun signs in the two systems of astrology is said to be 24 degrees, meaning that one might identify with a different constellation.

In Vedic astrology, a master astrologer, known as a Jyotish Acharaya, uses a variety of charts to further refine the individual s horoscope.
