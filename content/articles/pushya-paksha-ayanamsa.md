## Pushya-paksha Ayanamsa
by Great Astrologer PVR Narasimha Rao, his free and best Jagannatha Hora software.

### Jagannatha Hora

PVR Narasimha Rao Garu had done a great exemplary service and Punya to Vedic Astrology.

He is the Seer of Modern Vedic Astrology after B.V.Raman. No doubt about that.

His software the “Jagannatha Hora” is the best and unique software made ever.

Without this software, no research can be done in Vedic Astrology.

Pranam Guru. Hats Off to you.

#### Calculation of Ayanamsa

Pushya Paksha Ayanamsa is a well thought proposition. Its effectiveness has to be tested for many years, to really comment on that.

Pushya is a star or nakshatra in Karkataka (Cancer), or Summer solstice as in western astrology.


It is a good and logical attempt by PVR Narasimha Rao with latest modern observed astronomical data, to propose Pushya as a reference point for calculating “Start of Aries”. The Ayanamsa thereby calculated is under observation for prediction.

Pushya is on the elliptical plane and at center of Cancer, Pushya ruled by Guru is an epoch changing research.

Rather this ayanamsa has great future for western astrology also, as it is in Summer solstice, when the day time is the longest. This should help delineating lagna for longitudes near the poles.
