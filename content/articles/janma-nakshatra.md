### How is your Janma Nakshatra or janma star determined?

The Nakshatra in which moon is placed at the time of your birth is your Janma Nakshatra or birth star.

Nakshatras are significants of your mental attitude. This significance is rules by Moon, who rules Mind.

The Lunar affections of Moon has a profound effect on us.

There are 27 Nakshatras, each governing a arc of 13 degrees 20 minutes of the zodiac.

Each have a name and governed by a planet.

Each nakshatra is again divided into four parts called Padas, which are assigned in a cyclical way to the 12 zodiac signs.

This defines the significance in a much finer way.

The padas become part of the Navamsa chart, which is a derived chart from Natal or Birth chart.

The placement of Moon in a Nakshatra, decides the starting of the Timing in Vedic Astrology, namely Vimshottari Dasha system.

The Moon wanes and waxes, which is determined by its angular distance from Sun. Every Lunar arc is 12 degrees which is called a Tithi.

Tihi with Nakshatra places an important role in Hindu Calendar called Panchang.
