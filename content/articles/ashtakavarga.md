**Ashtakavarga system** deals with transit or [Gochara of Grahas](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/gochara) (Planets) in Bhavas (Houses). It has less significance in natal chart interpretation and Mundane Predictions and timing of events.

The principle of this system is as follows

* Grahas transition in a sign.

* Each sign is divided into 8 kakshas or parts.

* Each Kaksha is 3 deg 45 min. For 8 kakshas the total is 30 degrees of a sign.

* Each Kaksha is ruled by a Graha.

* The sequence of Kakshas are Shani (Saturn), Guru (Jupiter), Kuja (Mars), Surya (Sun), Shukra (Venus), Budha (Mercury), Chandra (Moon) and Lagna. The sequence is mathematically based on the decreasing order of the time taken by the grahas, to transit a sign.

* Rahu and Ketu move in retrograde motion and not taken for positive Mundane Predictions in Ashtakavarga.

* Each house of a Graha and Houses gets benefitted or strength.

* Ashtakavarga is done for each graha and also a cumulative Ashtakavarga called  **Sarva Ashtakavarga**. The total sum of Sarva Ashtakavarga on all 12 bhavas is 337.

I have 33 in 1st house. A self made person with a strong mind.
